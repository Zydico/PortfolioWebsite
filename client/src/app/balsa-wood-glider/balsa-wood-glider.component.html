        This was a group project taken during the MAE 215 class of Spring 2021 at WVU (Introduction to Aerospace Engineering). We were a group of 5 with the goal of the project being to
        design and build a glider out of sheets of balsa wood. There were certain restrictions such as being a minimum length, and being forced to use ribbed wings, and the plane also
        had to meet certain goals, such as flying at least 50 feet. The plane was designed on SOLIDWORKS, before being cut out from balsa wood with a laser cutter, and then assembled. My
        personal contribution was in the research and design of the airfoil shape and wing on SOLIDWORKS.
