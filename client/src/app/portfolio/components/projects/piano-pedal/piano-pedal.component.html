        This was a group project taken during the MAE 211 class of Spring 2022 at WVU (Mechatronics). We were a group of 4 with the goal of the project being to
        design and build a mechatronic device that would be useful for someone with a disability. We decided to go with my idea of a device that would enable someone
        with lower body impairment to be able to utilize a piano pedal with only the use of their mouth with a button. I was responsible for the initial idea and design,
        the SOLIDWORKS modeling, the coding for the Arduino in MATLAB and with the Arduino IDE, Arduino circuiting, the objectives/project description/team management parts
        of the report, and the final video.
